## Prompt Configuration Comparison

| Aspect                 | Instructions                                                                                                                                               | Prompt                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Configuration Style    | In-code (embedded in Python script).                                                                                                                       | External (via OpenAI API/dashboard).                                                                       |
| Static vs. Dynamic     | Can be static string or dynamic function (sync/async, context-aware).                                                                                      | Inherently dynamic; uses DynamicPromptFunction or API IDs for runtime changes.                             |
| Scope                  | Primarily the system prompt text.                                                                                                                          | Broader: Can configure instructions, tools, and other agent params dynamically.                            |
| Precedence/Interaction | Takes effect directly if provided; may conflict if prompt is also set (unresolved in docsâ€”GitHub issue notes potential overrides, but no official answer). | Likely overrides or merges with instructions when both are used, especially for dashboard-managed prompts. |
| Usability              | Works with any model; simple for prototyping.                                                                                                              | Limited to OpenAI models; requires Responses API integration.                                              |
| Customization          | Code-based, version-controlled.                                                                                                                            | Platform-based, for A/B testing or team collaboration without code changes.                                |
